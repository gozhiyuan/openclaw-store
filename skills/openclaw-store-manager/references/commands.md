## Manifest patterns

Project-scoped skill targeting:

```yaml
skills:
  - id: github
    targets:
      agents:
        - pm
        - tech-lead
```

```yaml
skills:
  - id: last30days
    targets:
      teams:
        - research-lab
```

Project definition:

```yaml
project:
  id: my-project
  name: "My Project"
  starter: podcast-production-pipeline
  entry_team: dev-company
```

Starter-generated project with team-wide manager skill:

```yaml
skills:
  - id: openclaw-store-manager
    targets:
      teams:
        - content-factory
```

When an external skill is missing, guide the user to install or configure it in OpenClaw first, optionally run `openclaw-store skill sync` to refresh availability, then re-run `openclaw-store install` so the targeted agents receive it.
