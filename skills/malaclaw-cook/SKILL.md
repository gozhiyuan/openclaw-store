# MalaClaw Manager

This skill manages `malaclaw` projects. It is for project topology, skill placement, and install health, not for executing end-user work inside the project itself.

It must also work safely when a repo is not yet managed by `malaclaw`.

## Use It For

- Bootstrapping `malaclaw` itself when the user only provided this `SKILL.md`
- Listing installed projects and entry points
- Listing, inspecting, and initializing starter demo projects
- Reading demo-project metadata and starter cards to choose between default workflow and managed workflow
- Promoting an ad hoc OpenClaw workflow into `default-managed` or a fuller managed project
- Inspecting a project's manifest, lockfile, and runtime registration
- Adding or removing packs in `malaclaw.yaml`
- Adding a skill to a project and targeting it to the correct agents or teams
- Re-running install so agent workspaces and skills are refreshed
- Checking skill activation and install failures

## Core Rules

- First determine whether the repo is in managed mode, default Claude Code mode, default OpenClaw mode, or unconfigured mode.
- Do not assume OpenClaw auto-installs missing skills.
- Do not assume a project skill is attached to every agent.
- Use the demo-project card and starter metadata to recommend either the default workflow or a managed team install.
- Prefer editing `malaclaw.yaml`, then running `malaclaw diff`, then `malaclaw install`.
- After changing project packs or skills, verify with `malaclaw doctor` and `malaclaw skill check`.
- Do not remove packs or skills unless the user asked for that change.
- malaclaw runs ON TOP OF OpenClaw. OpenClaw is the runtime (memory, skills, sessions).
  malaclaw scaffolds the project structure, agents, and skill targeting.
- Single-agent mode: use `default-managed` starter — one generalist agent, no team overhead.
  Do not build a full team unless the user explicitly wants multi-agent coordination.
- Available bundled teams: dev-company, content-factory, research-lab, autonomous-startup
- Skills are per agent, not per team. Each agent YAML declares its own skills list.

## Workflow

### 0. Bootstrap `malaclaw` if needed

If the user gave you this `SKILL.md` directly and `malaclaw` is not yet available:

1. Check whether `malaclaw` is already on PATH.
2. If not, acquire the repo locally:
   - if the current workspace is already the `malaclaw` repo, use it
   - otherwise clone the repo the user referenced
3. From the repo root, run:
   - `npm install`
   - `npm run build`
   - `npm link`
4. Verify with:
   - `malaclaw --help`
5. Then continue with the normal zero-config bootstrap:
   - `malaclaw install`

If the user does not want a local CLI install, explain that this skill can still guide the workflow conceptually, but project initialization and managed install steps require the `malaclaw` command to exist locally.

### 1. Inspect the current state

Run the smallest commands that answer the question:

- `malaclaw starter list`
- `malaclaw starter show <starter-id>`
- `malaclaw starter suggest "<idea>"`
- `malaclaw project list`
- `malaclaw project show <project-id>`
- `malaclaw project status`
- `malaclaw team show <team-id>`
- `malaclaw agent show <agent-id>`
- `malaclaw skill show <skill-id>`
- `malaclaw skill sync`

If the user asks which agent to open in OpenClaw, prefer the project entry-point agent from `project show`.

If the repo is not managed yet:

- explain which default workflow was detected
- do not claim missing `malaclaw.yaml` is an error by itself
- suggest `malaclaw init` only when the user wants managed projects, teams, or skills

If the user already has a working ad hoc OpenClaw workflow and wants structure:

1. inspect the current repo and runtime state
2. list the skills they already rely on
3. decide whether they need:
   - default workflow only
   - `default-managed`
   - a fuller starter/team install
4. if the workflow is repeated, shared, or coordination-heavy, recommend promotion
5. create or edit `malaclaw.yaml`
6. target discovered OpenClaw skills into the project
7. run `malaclaw install`
8. tell the user which entry-point agent to use next

If the user is starting from an idea:

1. run `malaclaw starter suggest "<idea>"`
2. inspect the closest starter with `starter show`
3. inspect the matching demo card in `demo-projects/cards/<starter-id>.md` when you need setup or workflow guidance
4. decide whether the user should stay in default workflow mode or move into managed starter mode
5. if a starter is close enough, run `starter init`
6. edit the generated `malaclaw.yaml` to customize packs, skills, or targets
7. run `malaclaw install`

If no starter is close enough:

- prefer `default-managed` for a lightweight managed starting point
- otherwise choose the simplest relevant starter anyway
- initialize it
- modify the generated project manifest rather than building everything from scratch
- explain which parts were inherited vs customized

### 1b. Promote to project

When the user says things like:

- "turn this into a project"
- "make this repeatable"
- "I already have the skills, now organize it"
- "should this become a team"

follow this promotion flow:

1. detect current mode: default OpenClaw, default Claude Code, or already managed
2. inspect currently available skills with `malaclaw skill sync`
3. identify whether the workflow is:
   - single-agent but persistent
   - multi-step with repeated tools
   - multi-agent or delegation-heavy
4. recommend:
   - stay unmanaged
   - `default-managed`
   - closest starter + customization
5. initialize the project
6. attach or retarget the existing skills the user already has in OpenClaw
7. run install, then hand off to the managed project entry-point agent

### 2. Add or retarget a skill

When a project needs a skill:

1. Confirm the skill exists as a template
   or is already available in OpenClaw via `malaclaw skill list` / `skill sync`
2. Edit `malaclaw.yaml`
3. Add the skill under `skills:`
4. Target it to the correct agents or teams with `targets.agents` or `targets.teams`
5. Run `malaclaw diff`
6. Run `malaclaw install`
7. Run `malaclaw skill check`
8. If the user asked for a stronger refresh, run `malaclaw install --force`

If the skill is an external OpenClaw skill rather than a repo-bundled one:

1. tell the user which skill or API integration is missing
2. guide them to install or configure it in OpenClaw first
3. verify it exists locally
4. run `malaclaw skill sync` if you want to refresh the local availability inventory
5. then re-run `malaclaw install` so it is attached to the targeted agents

Example:

```yaml
skills:
  - id: malaclaw-cook
    targets:
      agents:
        - tech-lead
        - ceo
```

Or team-wide:

```yaml
skills:
  - id: github
    targets:
      teams:
        - dev-company
```

### 3. Handle missing or inactive skills

If install reports a missing skill source:

- check `malaclaw skill show <skill-id>`
- inspect the skill's source and install hints
- use the demo card's `installable_skills`, `required_apis`, `required_capabilities`, and `setup_guidance` to explain the missing dependency in project terms
- do not claim the skill is installed until `skill check` or install output confirms it

If install reports inactive status:

- check required environment variables
- explain what is missing
- re-run install after configuration is fixed

### 4. Verify skill is in agent's allowlist

OpenClaw uses `agent.skills[]` in openclaw.json as a skill filter:

- **omit** `skills` key = agent has unrestricted access to all skills
- **`skills: []`** = agent has access to no skills (empty allowlist)
- **`skills: [...]`** = only the listed skill IDs are available to the agent

If install succeeds but a skill isn't loading in an agent session, check whether the agent's entry in openclaw.json has a `skills:` key that excludes it. Re-running `malaclaw install` automatically patches this — it adds installed skill IDs to any agent entries that already have an explicit `skills[]` allowlist.

### 5. OpenClaw memory tools

Two distinct memory mechanisms exist in malaclaw managed projects:

**OpenClaw native memory** (runtime-owned):
- `memory_search` and `memory_get` are native OpenClaw tools
- They index files in **this agent's own workspace directory** (MEMORY.md, memory/*.md)
- Each agent workspace includes a MEMORY.md that explains this

**Shared team markdown files** (malaclaw convention):
- kanban.md, tasks-log.md, etc. are scaffolded by malaclaw as coordination files
- They live **outside** each agent's indexed workspace (in the team's shared memory directory)
- Access them **by file path**, not via `memory_search` — they are not indexed by OpenClaw
- They are a project/team coordination layer on top of OpenClaw, not a replacement for native memory

See MEMORY.md in each agent workspace for the exact paths and access patterns.

Note: Claude Code remains unsupported as a runtime target until a real adapter is built
(`src/lib/adapters/claude-code.ts` is still a stub). Use OpenClaw as the runtime.

## Project Initialization Flow

When a user asks to spin up a project or demo, follow this sequence exactly:

### Step 1: Suggest a starter
Run `malaclaw starter suggest "<user idea>"`.
Present the closest match: name, entry team, project skills, installable skills, required APIs, and required capabilities.

### Step 2: Confirm and initialize
Once the user confirms the starter and target directory:
- If the demo is `family-calendar-household-assistant`: ask "Do you use Google Calendar or Apple Calendar?" and note the answer — you will target only the user's chosen calendar skill during install.
- Run `malaclaw starter init <starter-id> <dir>`
  This creates: `malaclaw.yaml`, `STARTER.md`, `DEMO_PROJECT.md`

### Step 3: Detect skill gaps
Run `malaclaw skill sync`
- This checks what is already installed in OpenClaw
- Compare against the project's targeted skills and the demo card's `installable_skills`
- If skill sync fails (OpenClaw offline or unreachable): warn the user and ask them to confirm each required skill manually before you proceed

### Step 4: Guide missing skills and auth
For each missing or inactive skill the user wants in the project:
1. State which skill is missing and which agent(s) need it
2. If it is an OpenClaw skill, guide the user to install it in OpenClaw first
3. Use `malaclaw skill show <skill-id>` and demo metadata to explain env vars or API auth that are still missing
4. Re-run `malaclaw skill sync` to confirm presence when relevant
5. Only target the skill into the managed project once it exists or the user explicitly wants to proceed without it

### Step 5: Install
After the starter and skill targeting are in the right state, run the managed install.

Run from the project directory:
```
cd <dir>
malaclaw install
```

### Step 6: Verify
Run `malaclaw doctor`
All installed agents and targeted skills should be healthy.

### Step 7: Hand off to user
Tell the user:
- The exact agent ID to open in OpenClaw (the entry-point agent)
- A concrete first task to give that agent, based on the demo's bootstrap_prompt

Example handoff:
"Your Habit Tracker is ready. Open this agent in OpenClaw:
→ `store__<project-id>__personal-assistant__personal-assistant-lead`

Give it a task like:
'Set up daily habit tracking for: morning exercise, reading 30 mins, and no phone after 9pm.
Send me a daily accountability check-in at 8pm via Telegram.'"
