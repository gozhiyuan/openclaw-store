## Trust tiers

| Tier | Requirements |
|---|---|
| `local` | User-owned, not reviewed |

| `curated` | Maintainer-recommended, tested on multiple OpenClaw versions |

## Running tests

## Compatibility policy

Each pack YAML should include a `compatibility` block declaring the minimum OpenClaw and Node versions it was tested with. CI will validate against the versions listed in `compatibility-matrix.yaml`.
